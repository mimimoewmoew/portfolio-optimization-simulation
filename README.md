# Project Overview
Project Title: Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis  
Level: Beginner  
Database: yfinance  
This project simulates 10,000 randomly generated investment portfolios using historical data from ETFs (SPY, QQQ, TLT, GLD, SHY) and applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to identify optimal allocations.

## Objectives
1.**Download real market data** using 'yfinance'  
2.Calculate **annualized returns, volatility, and covariance**  
3.**Simulate portfolio combinations** with random weights  
4.Visualize the **Efficient Frontier and identify**:
  - ⭐ The Max Sharpe Ratio portfolio
  - ❌ The Minimum Volatility portfolio

## Key Insights

- Optimal portfolio achieved the best risk-adjusted return based on the Sharpe Ratio
- Diversifying with equities and long/short-term bonds reduced portfolio risk
- Risk-return tradeoff is clearly visualized and quantified

## Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- 'yfinance', 'numpy', 'pandas', 'matplotlib'
- GitHub for project presentation
